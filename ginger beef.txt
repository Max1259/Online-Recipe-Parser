30 Minute Ginger Beef

Ingredients:
-1 pound skirt steak, sliced thinly (flank steak or beef tenderloin will work too)
-1 cup cornstarch
-2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying
-1 large white onion, finely chopped
-1 1/2 cups carrots, julienned (can use grated or shredded carrots too)
-3 cloves garlic, minced
-1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
-1/2 teaspoon dried red chili flakes
-1/2 cup light soy sauce
-2 tablespoons vinegar (rice vinegar or white vinegar)
-1 tablespoon sesame oil
-1/2 teaspoon black pepper
-1/2 cup brown sugar, lightly packed
-2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
-1/4 cup green onions, thinly sliced

Instructions:
-Toss the steak with the corn starch in a large bowl and set aside.
-Over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and onions to a sauce pan.  Saut for two minutes until onions are translucent.
-Add the carrots to the onions and saut for 3-4 minutes until tender.
-Next, add the garlic, ginger, and chili flakes.  Stir into the carrots and onions.  Cook for 1-2 minutes.
-Lastly, add the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, black pepper, brown sugar, and sesame seeds.  Whisk together.
-Lower the heat to a simmer and allow the sauce to slightly thicken.
-In the meantime, bring about 2-3 cups of vegetable oil to optimum frying temperature in a deep skillet.  Shake the excess corn starch off the beef and fry each piece in batches until crispy.  This process takes about 3-4 minutes.  Drain the fried beef on paper towels.
-Toss the fried beef with the sauce mixture.  Garnish with green onions. Serve immediately.
